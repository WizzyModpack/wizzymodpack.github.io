Wizzy is a Minecraft modpack, available exclusively on the [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads).

## About

A Minecraft modpack is a collection of modifications for the game Minecraft, which are automatically installed on top of Minecraft through programs such as the ATLauncher. You still require a Microsoft account with a valid Minecraft license when using the ATLauncher.

Wizzy is a fully customisable modpack that brings together many categories of Minecraft mods, such as Adventure, Magic, Building and Technology. You can choose one of our pre-defined sets of mods, or create your own.   
Since 2015, the goal of Wizzy has been to provide players with an experience tailored to each play style, so that you can get the most fun out of Minecraft.
